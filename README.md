### Hello World 👋

📛 My name is Adam.

🏢 I am the founder and CEO of [The Migus Group](https://migusgroup.com).

👔 I help our clients locate and address the cybersecurity risk in their environments.

📖 I have focused on cybersecurity throughout my career in defense, banking, healthcare, and services.
I read and write software in Golang, C#, and Python nowadays but I used to write a lot of Java, C, shell, and Perl too.
I can learn and adapt quickly to any technology stack as a result of all that experience.

🧰 I use tools like Ansible and Docker (podman).
I can manage Linux and Windows hosts, whether on-prem or in the cloud.

⭐ I really enjoy learning about operating systems and security but client satisfaction is ultimately what drives me! 🚀
