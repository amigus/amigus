### Hello, World! 👋

📛 My name is Adam.

🏢 I am the Founder and CEO of [The Migus Group](https://github.com/The-Migus-Group).

👔 I help organizations reduce their cybersecurity risk. I analyze, develop, maintain, and secure software.

📖 I write Golang, Python, and C# nowadays, but I have also written a lot of C, Java, Perl, and UNIX Shell.

🧰 I frequently use tools like Ansible, Docker (podman), and PowerShell.
