### Hello World 👋

📛 My name is Adam.

🏢 I'm the founder and CEO of [The Migus Group](https://migusgroup.com).

👔 I help our clients create, improve, and understand secure software systems and the processes they use to manage them.

📖 I have focused on information security throughout my career in defense, banking, healthcare, and services. I read and write software primarily in Java, C, Python, and Go, but I'm flexible on language and platform, and I learn quickly.

🧰 I use tools like Ansible and Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, and more. I can manage Linux and Windows hosts, whether on-prem or in the cloud.

⭐ I'm highly skilled and experienced in software and systems integration, SDLC re-engineering, and cloud migration, automation, and scaling.
